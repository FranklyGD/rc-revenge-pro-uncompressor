# RC Revenge Pro .BBK Uncompressor
A Python script to uncompress .BBK files from the PS2 game, RC Revenge Pro

Warning:
This does not work with RC Revenge (PS1), as those .BBK files are different.

Usage:
Place bbload.py in the root directory of your extracted copy of RC Revenge Pro.
The first argument is the .BBK file you want to uncompress
(i.e. `python bbload.py 98` will uncompress `BB\9\8.BBK`).

Results will be saved in `BBDecomp\*\*\` as 3 or 4 files.
